# AlternateCreditModel
The alternative credit risk model focuses on the target group of customers with little or no credit history to evaluate customer credit risk assessment on the basis of other relevant feature points in modern times like utility payments data, social media profile, psychometric test,etc and create an alternate credit score.

We divide the alternate scoring model into two sub-models for scoring:
1. Repayment capacity - This includes calculating the users disposable income after utility and rent payments to check if he is in a position to repay. User-permissible data is employed to detect bad repayment behaviours, existing debts and other useful insights.

2. Lifestyle assessment matrix - This involves creation of a personality matrix of the customer based on a psychometric analysis, social media activity and existing users spending habits. This data helps map a personna of the user indicating the willingness to repay.
